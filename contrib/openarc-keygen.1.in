.Sh NAME
.Nm openarc-keygen
.Nd DKIM (and ARC) key generation tool

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm openarc-keygen
.Fl d Ar domain
.Fl s Ar selector
.Op options

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm openarc-keygen
outputs a private key suitable for signing messages using
.Xr openarc 8
and also outputs one of several representations of the associated
public key, which can be used in various ways.

The output filenames are based on the
.Ar selector
and
.Ar domain ;
the private key will end in ".key" and the public key will end in ".txt".

.Sh OPTIONS

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b , Fl \-bits Ar bits
Size of RSA key to generate.
The default is 2048, which is also the recommended minimum size.
Keys smaller than 1024 bits will almost certainly be rejected by
downstream evaluators.

.It Fl d , Fl \-domain Ar domain
The domain which will use this key for signing.

.It Fl D , Fl -directory Ar directory
Directory to store the keys in.
If this is not specified the keys will be stored in the current
working directory.

.It Fl f , Fl \-format Brq Cm bare | Cm testkey | Cm text | Cm zone
Output format for the public key.
.Cm bare
outputs just the key itself, rendering many flags that this program accepts
irrelevant.
.Cm testkey
outputs a line suitable for use in a file pointed to by
the
.Cm TestKeys
option in
.Xr openarc.conf 5 .
.Cm text
outputs a standard textual representation of the key as specified in RFC 6376.
.Cm zone
is the default, and outputs a DNS record formatted for use in a zone file.

.It Fl \-fqdn
When outputting a DNS zone file entry, use the fully qualified domain name
instead of a relative one.

.It Fl \-hash-algorithms Ar algorithms
Tag the public key to indicate that it should only be used with
this colon-separated list of algorithms.

.It Fl h , Fl \-help
Show a help message and exit.

.It Fl \-no\-subdomains
Tag the public key to indicate that identities in a signature are
required to be from this exact domain, not subdomains.

.It Fl n , Fl \-note Ar note
Free-form text to include in the public key.
This is intended for humans who are reading the record, and should be
kept brief if it is used at all.

.It Fl r , Fl \-restrict
Tag the public key to indicate that it should only be used for email.
There are not currently any other protocols that might use the key, so
this does not have any practical effect.

.It Fl s , Fl \-selector Ar selector
A name for the key.

.It Fl t , Fl \-type Brq Cm rsa | Cm ed25519
Type of key to generate, defaults to RSA.
Note that Ed25519 keys are not currently useful for ARC, nor are
they usable by OpenARC.
This option is for people who are generating DKIM keys for use with
other software.

.It Fl \-testing
Tag the public key to indicate that this domain is testing its
deployment of the protocol this key is used with.
This is a signal that you are more interested in receiving feedback,
it does not affect the handling of messages or signatures.

.Sh NOTES
A suitable
.Nm openssl
executable must be available in the executing user's
.Ev PATH .

.Sh EXAMPLES
You may want to use
.Xr sudo 8
to run this command as the user that the
.Xr openarc 8
daemon is configured to run as, so that the file permissions are correct.

.Dl sudo -u openarc openarc-keygen -D /etc/openarc/keys -d example.com -s 20241004
